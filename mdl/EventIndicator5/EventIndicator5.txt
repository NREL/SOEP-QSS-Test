EventIndicator5 Model Notes

This is a simple event indicator test model with
a zero-crossing function that modifies a state
variable derivative via a discrete variable.

Notes:

OCT event indicators and their dependencies are
correct and short-circuit out the discrete variable
dependencies. If the discrete variable is changed
to an output the dependencies are not short-circuited.

The QSS-FMU zero crossing coordination is not
working in some cases: this needs to be resolved.
