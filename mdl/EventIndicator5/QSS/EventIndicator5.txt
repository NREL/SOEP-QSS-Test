EventIndicator5 Model QSS Notes

The event indicator requantizations are triggered by discontinuities
at the sample times that cause large numerical derivatives.

The QSS3 run is sensitive to the numeric differentiation time step
to get the zero-crossings detected.

The QSS-FMU zero crossing coordination is not
working in some cases: this needs to be resolved.
