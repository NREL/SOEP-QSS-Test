TwoFloor_TwoZone Model QSS Notes

Standard QSS demonstrates derivative sensitivities to the use of
stale quantized trajectories in derivatives, particularly wrt
self-observer state variables. The experimental QSS variant that
propagates current continuous trajectories gives much improved
results but tracking still breaks down. This behavior is seen in
some of the other Buildings models and is being investigated.
