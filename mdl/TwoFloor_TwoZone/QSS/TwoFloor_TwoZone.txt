TwoFloor_TwoZone Model QSS Notes

Standard QSS demonstrates derivative sensitivities to the use of
stale quantized trajectories in derivatives, particularly for
self-observer state variables. The experimental QSS variant that
propagates current continuous trajectories gives much improved
results but tracking still breaks down. This behavior is seen in
some of the other Buildings models and is being investigated.

This sensitivity could be inherent to the model or due to some
state that is taking steps that are too large, possibly due to
missing dependencies.

QSS3 shows greater sensitivity than QSS2.
