DepTest4 Model OCT Notes

OCT doesn't expose the temporary variables used for the events generated by
the integer() function in modelDescription.xml but has bypass dependencies
of the event indicators on each other. This is sufficient for the 2022 QSS
revamp where inter event indicator dependency is supported but doesn't
allow the discrete temporary variable to act as a firewall against unnecessary
update propagation (which is not useful for this model where every handler
event does change the event indicator zero-crossing functions).

OCT version OCT-master-7245bce03ab2ebdfdaaf0805d75209efaa009c67 is missing
the dependencies of the event indicators on the intermediate discrete variable
d. The 2022 QSS revamp can produce the correct simulation because the event
indicators have dependencies on each other but in this case d is treated as
a passive variable, so it cannot serve as an update firewall and its trajectory
can only be seen with sampled output.
