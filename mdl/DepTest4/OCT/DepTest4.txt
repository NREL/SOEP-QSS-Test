DepTest4 Model OCT Notes

With OCT version OCT-dev-cw-5212-18478f3488ff1272c52222a29d72215983eadeec
the temporary variables used for the event generated by the integer()
function are removed from the modelDescription.xml with their dependencies
short-circuited. This prevents QSS from producing the correct simulation
as the dependency of event indicators on time does not trigger updates of
the event indicator variables because time has no update event (unlike
integer(time).

While removal of the temporary variable between handler-modified variables
and the corresponding event indicators is helpful for QSS (QSS can also
remove them) this model shows that temporary variables cannot all be
removed from the dependency graph, specifically those created to implement
event-generating functions that will have discrete update events that the
surrounding (non-temporary) variables won't.
