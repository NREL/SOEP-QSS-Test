DepTest4 Model QSS Notes

With OCT version OCT-dev-cw-5212-18478f3488ff1272c52222a29d72215983eadeec
the temporary variables used for the event generated by the integer()
function are removed from the modelDescription.xml with their dependencies
short-circuited. This prevents QSS from producing the correct simulation
as the dependency of event indicators on time does not trigger updates of
the event indicator variables because time has no update event (unlike
integer(time).

Running QSS with a sufficiently small --dtMax option forces it to
produce a reasonably accurate simulation.
