StateEvent6 Model JModelica Notes

Since there are two when clauses the model should have 2 zero-crossing functions
but it works here with 1 because the clause expressions are mutually exclusive
and the zero-crossing functions for FMUs are set to fire with crossings in either
direction (since the FMI API doesn't expose crossing direction information).

XML Modifications
 Build script ran mod_xml.py to add index comments
 Added dependencies for zero-crossing (__zc_z) and discrete (y) variables
