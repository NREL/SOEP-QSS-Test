ASHRAE2006 Model QSS Notes

As of the 2020/11 OCT update the QSS simulation drifts off track unless a small dtMax is
used and shows derivative sensitivities that cause very slow run times with standard QSS
solvers. The experimental continuous trajectory propagating QSS variant improves the
result but does not fully resolve the simulation problems.

Investigation Plan:
- Compare shorter runs with full QSS diagnostics
  - Look at variables dominating requantizations
  - Find first point of divergence and identify cause (missed ZC?)
    - Get ZC event times out of PyFMI by running with and without --soo arg to run_PyFMI.py
- Try LIQSS runs to see if stiffness is a factor
