ASHRAE2006 Model OCT Notes

OCT gives a number of warnings when generating the FMU.

PyFMI run gives warnings including out of bounds.

The r19089 OCT update and the late-2020 updated model
generate fewer event indicators and the results are
mildly changed.

This update fails to run the FMU with PyFMI if the
generate_ode_jacobian is used, giving:
Simulation failed:  'The right-hand side function had repeated recoverable errors. At time 80280.000000.'
