DataCenterDiscreteTimeControl Model QSS Notes

Directional derivatives are not working with this model so the
zero-crossing accuracy and robustness are limited.

As of the OCT-r23206_JM-r14295 OCT update the QSS tracks fairly well but
displays some noise and runs slower than CVode (without tolerance matching).
