TimeTestCross Model QSS Notes

The QSS runs show the same issue as TimeTest, where the
missing dependency of the event indicators on the discrete
variable appearing in their zero-crossing functions prevent
QSS from simulating correctly. In this model also shows that
it isn't sufficient to do an event indicator update after its
own "handler" runs since the two discrete nextSample variables
are modified by handlers of each others event indicator block.

This model also exposes another issue: this use of pre() in the
zero-crossing function:
  when time >= pre(nextSample1) then
causes the directional derivative for the event indicator to lose
the time contribution as described in Issue #16 for the
ACControl10 model. So even with the event indicator forwad
dependencies on the nextSample variables added QSS is not able
to simulate this model correctly.
