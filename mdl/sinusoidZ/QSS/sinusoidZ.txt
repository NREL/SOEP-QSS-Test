sinusoidZ Model QSS Notes

CVode and QSS have more trouble with FMU zero-crossing detection as the
sinusoid "dips" below zero are made smaller. For this model QSS2 and
QSS3 runs with suitable options detecting more of the zero crossings
than CVode.

QSS3 has difficulty with this model due to ND noise. Runs with rTol=1e-4
can miss most of the crossings no matter what ND time step is used.
