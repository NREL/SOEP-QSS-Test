sinusoidZ Model QSS Notes

The QSS runs have more trouble with FMU zero-crossing detection as the
sinusoid "dips" below zero are made smaller.

QSS3 has more difficulty with this model due to ND noise. Runs with
rTol=1e-4 can miss most of the crossings no matter what ND time step
is used.

With the "dips" and rTol made not too challenging the QSS runs show
that a zFac>1 can be used successfully to reduce zero-crossing variable
requantizations without causing more crossings to be missed.
