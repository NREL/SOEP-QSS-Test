sinusoidZ Model Notes

This model is a zero-crossing "torture test" with a high-frequency
sinusoidal zero-crossing function and difficult "bounce" crossings.

The high frequency sinusoid does not allow a low order polynomial
trajectory to have a large time span of accuracy so requantizations
will be needed to assure accurate zero-crossings as zero is approached.

The sinuoid dependency directly on the time variable, which never
requantizes, will trip up algorithms that exploit zero-crossing
dependency requantizations in place of zero-crossing variable
requantizations.

The sinusoid has significant derivatives of every order so it
should present the same obstacles to all QSS order methods.

Since zero-crossing variables have no observers and don't have the
cumulative drift error of integrated state variables we would like
to avoid many requantizations of them when they are "far" from a
zero crossing, but robust algorithms to exploit this are tricky
because, without specific information such as derivative bounds,
we cannot know from current trajectory information that we are
actually far from the next zero crossing. Algorithm variants
designed to do less zero-crossing variable requantization should
be tested against this model.
