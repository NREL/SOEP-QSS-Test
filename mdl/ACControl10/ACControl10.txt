ACControl10 Model Notes

This model is adapted from the ACControlDeterministicDymola10 model in set of
examples used in and provided by the authors of the paper:
On the Efficiency of Quantizationâ€“Based Integration Methods for Building Simulation
https://usuarios.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~kofman/files/buildings_qss.pdf

The CVode and QSS simulations of this model both give results that vary
significantly with tolerance and other changes so its value for solver
comparisons is limited.
