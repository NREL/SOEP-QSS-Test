ACControl10 Model QSS Notes

The QSS simulation is wrong. At least one reason is that the
event indicator dependencies don't include the th[*] variables
that most of them depend on. For example:
    when th[1] > tref + dtref + 0.5 then
      on[1] := 1;
    elsewhen th[1] < tref + dtref - 0.5 then
      if time > 0 then
        on[1] := 0;
      end if;
    end when;

The when blocks are in the algorithms section, which has known
limitations with the dependencies. Since this use of algorithm
is not believed common in Buildings Library models this may be
a non-critical issue.
