ACControl10 Model OCT Notes

The CVode simulations are not very stable: results change significantly with changes
in tolerance and whether the FMU is built with QSS and directional derivative options.
At some point in most runs the temperature derivatives begin flipping signs frequently.
Because of this variability this model is not a great basis for QSS vs traditional
solver comparisons.

There appear to be some issues with the event indicators...

All the event indicators have the same 10 reverse dependencies but the model does
not warrant that. The reverse dependencies are the derivatives of all 10 elements
of the th[] temperature vector. The 20 event indicators for the temperature-triggered
AC on/off when statements should each have a reverse dependency on only its own
der(th[i]) since it alters the on[i] vector element:
    der(th[i]) = ( THA - th[i] ) / ( RES[i] * CAP[i] ) - ( POT[i] * on[i] ) / CAP[i];
The unnecessary reverse dependencies are a performance/scalability problem.

The other event indicators, with discrete variables short-circuited, should have
reverse dependencies on those 20 temperature trigger event indicators, where dtref
appears.

The event indicator for the when statement
  when time > nextSample then
is #22 and the blt.html shows:
  _eventIndicator_22 := time - nextSample;
This event indicator has 11 (forward) dependencies on all the th[] variables and
time but since nextSample itself only depends on time it seems that it should have
only dependencies on time and nextSample.

The nextSample (forward) dependency of event indicator #22 is short-ciruited out
because it is a (non-output) discrete variable, but because it doesn't affect any
state variable directly the QSS event indicator variable is not updating when
nextSample changes.
