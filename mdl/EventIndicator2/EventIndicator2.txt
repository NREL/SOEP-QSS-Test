EventIndicator2 Model Notes

This is a simple event indicator test model with
a zero-crossing function that modifies a state
variable via the reinit function.

Notes:

OCT event indicator reverse dependency is on der(x).
It would be clearer if it were on x, but QSS treats
them the same way.

The QSS results are good.
