BouncingBall Model OCT Notes

As of OCT-master-8bb4688ea939e98a3f23be67236795ab5f2d3ac4 update released
in 2023/06 the self-dependency of v is added by OCT to the <Dependencies>
section of the XML file.

OCT 1.43.4 does not show a self-dependency for the v variable reinit
"handler" action in:
  when h < 0 then
    reinit(v, -e*pre(v));
  end when;

QSS needs the self-dependency so that it updates the value of v
in the FMU before running the FMU event loop at the predicted
zero-crossing.
