BouncingBall Model QSS Notes

The OCT FMU was used to generate the QSS results using its event indicator support.
The OCT FMU event indicator reverseDependencies was refined manually to point to
the velocity variable, v, for the more efficient and preferred QSS support.

QSS3 simulation of BouncingBall can take large requantization steps since the
ball height is a quadratic function of time between bounce events. (Because QSS
doesn't get that trajectory information it can generate small 3rd order terms
in the height trajectory so there can be a few requantizations between bounces.)
With the large steps the predicted zero-crossing time can be slightly off due to
roundoff so a larger than default zMul value or, less efficient, a dtInf
deactivation control is probably needed to get the FMU to detect all the zero
crossings. The --eidd option is also recommended to make the predicted zero
crossing times as accurate as possible.
