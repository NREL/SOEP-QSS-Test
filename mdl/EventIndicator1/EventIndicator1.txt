EventIndicator1 Model Notes

This is a simple event indicator test model with
a zero-crossing function that modifies a state
variable derivative via a discrete variable.

Notes:

OCT event indicators and their dependencies are
correct and short-circuit out the discrete variable
dependencies. If the discrete variable is changed
to an output the dependencies are not short-circuited.

QSS should not track discrete variables that are
short-circuited since without dependencies they
are not updated by QSS.

If the discrete variable is made into an output
the FMU and QSS output for it is updated, but as a
local variable there are no dependencies in the XML.
If the discrete variable is tracked by QSS the set
all variables call before reading local variables
from the FMU will wipe out changes to it made by the
FMU at zero-crossing events so using the --tLoc
option will not work to get the correct discrete
variable output.
Other than the discrete variable tracking, the QSS
results are good and do no requantizations as
expected in the ideal (infinite precision) case.

The QSS-FMU zero crossing coordination is not
working in some cases: this needs to be resolved.
