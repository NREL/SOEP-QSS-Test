Guideline36 Model QSS Notes

This model has a large number of event indicators:
 189 state variables
1001 event indicators with OCT-stable-r19089_JM-r14295
 734 event indicators with OCT-r23206_JM-r14295
 Almost all EIs have many (50+) forward and reverse dependencies and most are the same
 Most of these EIs have observer updates after every state requantization so QSS will run slowly

QSS runs progress very slowly due to the event indicators.


Some event indicators do not track CVode results from very early.
For example, _eventIndicator_474 has larger 2nd derivative than in CVode.
Running with --dep changes _eventIndicator_474 trajectory but it still doesn't match CVode so might indicate missing dependencies but it isn't clear.
See if removing --bin affects it: if so then simultaneous processing could be a problem.
See if using q-based state observees fixes it.
See if dtND affects it: if so ND may be the cause: Try better (slower) ND formulations.
Trace early behavior and look at EI equations to find first point of divergence.
 But it seems like 2nd derivative is too large right from t=0.
Can it be non-SI units?


With default zMul the ZCs are being missed: setting zMul=1 works.
This shows that ZC protocol is still not robust enough.
Ask team to suggest improvements.
Stress that imperative ZCs are probably needed for production use.
