Guideline36 Model QSS Notes

This model has a large number of event indicators:
 189 state variables
1001 event indicators with OCT-stable-r19089_JM-r14295
 734 event indicators with OCT-r23206_JM-r14295
 Almost all EIs have many (50+) forward and reverse dependencies and most are the same
 Most of these EIs have observer updates after every state requantization so QSS will run slowly

QSS runs progress very slowly due to the event indicators.
