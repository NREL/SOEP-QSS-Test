Guideline36 Model OCT Notes

FMUs built with QSS options have a large number of event indicators:
 189 state variables
1001 event indicators with OCT-stable-r19089_JM-r14295
 734 event indicators with OCT-r23206_JM-r14295
 Almost all EIs have many (50+) forward and reverse dependencies and most are the same

The modelDescription.xml file shows 176 derivatives but the FMIL API call only gets 171.
This breaks the QSS simulation.
