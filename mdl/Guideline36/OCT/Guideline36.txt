Guideline36 Model OCT Notes

FMUs built with QSS options have a large number of event indicators:
 189 state variables
1001 event indicators with OCT-stable-r19089_JM-r14295
 734 event indicators with OCT-r23206_JM-r14295
 Almost all EIs have many (50+) forward and reverse dependencies and most are the same

With the OCT-stable-r19089_JM-r14295 OCT update this model built with
generate_ode_jacobian progresses very slowly in PyFMI runs and
generates a large number of event indicators when QSS options are used.

With the OCT-r23206_JM-r14295 OCT update this model built with
generate_ode_jacobian fails in PyFMI CVode runs giving:
Simulation failed:  'The right-hand side function had repeated recoverable errors. At time 39120.000000.'
