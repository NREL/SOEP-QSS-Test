InputFunction Model QSS Notes

The QSS solver has a few sample input functions for use with FMU models
since input functions are not encoded within the FMU. The input function
can be selected at run time with the QSS --fxn option as in:
  QSS InputFunction.fmu --qss=QSS2 --fxn=u:step[1,1,1]

Notes:
* If not specified the input function defaults to a step function.
* The input function value at the simulation start time must match
  any input start value specified in the Modelica file.
* A PyFMI simulation of the FMU must use the same input function
  to get comparable results.

The OCT FMU was used to generate the QSS results using the run.py
script that applies the same step input function as the current QSS
default.

The QSS2+ runs are very fast because the model trajectories are
linear: it has 10 discrete input events and each causes a 
requantization of the state variable.
For comparison CVode uses 166 steps (with ncp set to 0 to prevent
extra steps at sampled output times).
