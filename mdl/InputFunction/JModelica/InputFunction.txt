InputFunction Model JModelica Notes

The custom run_fmu.step.py script duplicates the step input function
the QSS solver uses as the current default.

XML Modifications
 Build script ran mod_xml.py to add index comments
 No other XML modifications were required to run the FMU since no zero-crossing or discrete variables are present
