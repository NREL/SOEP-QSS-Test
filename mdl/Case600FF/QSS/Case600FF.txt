Case600FF Model QSS Notes

The 2020/04 OCT FMU slows to a crawl at ~400000 s with second derivatives getting large causing tiny steps

The Dymola FMU was used for QSS simulations.

The key room temperature variables, TRooQSS_K, outputs are the primary
basis for solution comparison.

A sampling rate of 100 s is suggested for comparison with the PyFMI solution.

The LIQSS solutions drift upward in temperature unless --dtInf deactivation
control is used. This is due to deactivation of the roo.air.vol.dynBal.mXi[1]
variable that (in the Dymola xml) has no observees other than itself.

xQSS2 runs are, like LIQSS runs, somewhat noisier. The use of --dtInf with
xQSS2 is recommended for this case.
