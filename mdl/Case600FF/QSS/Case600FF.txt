Case600FF Model QSS Notes

The 2020/04 OCT FMU slows to a crawl at ~400000 s with second derivatives getting large causing tiny steps

A sampling rate of 100 s is suggested for comparison with the PyFMI solution.

The LIQSS solutions drift upward in temperature unless --dtInf deactivation
control is used. This is due to deactivation of the roo.air.vol.dynBal.mXi[1]
variable that (in the Dymola xml) has no observees other than itself.

xQSS2 runs are, like LIQSS runs, somewhat noisier. The use of --dtInf with
xQSS2 is recommended for this case.

With the OCT-r23206_JM-r14295 OCT version some QSS3 runs give an fmi status error
during the simulation from an fmi2_import_get_real call for the roo.irRadExc.TOpa[7]
and return a large magnitude spike value -9.25596313493178e+61. Since the timing of
this error varies with the dtND value it appears to be a numeric differentiation
sensitivity. Also, the numeric differentiation time step optimizer reports a few
variables whose numeric third derivatives never stabilize as dtND is reduced.
