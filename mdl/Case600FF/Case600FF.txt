Case600FF Model Notes

This is a building thermal model that is a good validation case for the
QSS solver.

Although the room is thermally "free floating" (FF) there are a number of
event indicators in the FMU so the QSS results may not be correct until
the OCT event indicator support is complete and validated.

A detailed comparison of the Dymola CVODE and QSS solutions was made and
the out directory has spreadsheets with the comparison using 100 s and
63072 s sampling intervals.

Thierrys' Notes:

Buildings_ThermalZones_Detailed_Validation_BESTEST_Case600FF.fmu is the
FMU exported from the BESTEST model Case 600FF (Case600FF.mo).
Case600FF.mo can not be directly exported as an FMU.  This needs to be
done from the Buildings library (master branch).  I tried to export and
save the Case600FF.mo as a total model.  However, when I tried to
translate the total model, the translation fails because of missing
libraries.  Hence I put the original Modelica model here for future
reference until I sort out the translation issue.


Performance

Notes:
 The use of tolerances in QSS and Dymola differ and we have not yet found
  the best approach to setting them for comparable solution precision.

Timing (QSS1):
 rTol=aTol=0.0001	1496 s
 rTol=aTol=0.001	 174 s	Almost 10x faster
 rTol=0.001 aTol=0.0001	 179 s	So rTol dominates

Timing (QSS2):
 rTol=0.0001 aTol=1e-6	 364 s

Thierry's Timing (h/w unknown):
 Dymola:  Tol: 0.0001
  Native .mo		  42 s
  FMU			 133 s
  No discrete vars	  23 s	Not sure if this is .mo or FMU run
