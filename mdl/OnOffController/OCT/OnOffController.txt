OnOffController Model OCT Notes

The PyFMI runs do not produce correct results because the event indicators
do not fire. The event indicator dependencies do not match those of the __zc
variables added to the JModelica and Dymola versions of the model.

The adapted model built with OCT is not running correctly with PyFMI or QSS.
The zero-crossing functions are not firing for some reason.
