OnOffController Model QSS Notes

The QSS runs using the Dymola FMU work correctly.
The available JModelica FMU depends on libgfortran.so3 and so cannot be
run on current Fedora and the JModelica FMU build is failing.

The current OCT-generated FMU is not working correctly with PyFMI or QSS.
The FMU is not detecting zero crossings.

Notes

Need "observer" QSS outputs to show the temperature accurately without
sampled outputs since it depends only on conQSS.y and so doesn't
requantize often.
