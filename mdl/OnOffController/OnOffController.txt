OnOffController Model Notes

This model simulates an on/off controller that controls the room temperature
of a simple room modeled using a capacitor.

This model is adapted for local use from the OnOffController model in
https://github.com/lbl-srg/soep/tree/master/models/modelica_for_qss/QSS/Specific/Events

The adapted model built with OCT is not running correctly with PyFMI or QSS.
The FMU is not detecting zero crossings.

The original model built with Dymola runs correctly with PyFMI and QSS.
With default tolerances the QSS simulation captures the zero crossing times
more accurately while the PyFMI simulation output shows the crossings a bit
late. As the tolerances are reduced the difference is nearly eliminated.
