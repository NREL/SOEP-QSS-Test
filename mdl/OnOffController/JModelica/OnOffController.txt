OnOffController Model JModelica Notes

The JModelica FMU from the LBNL collection depends on libgfortran.so.3 so it could not be run on Fedora 27 at Objexx.

The JModelica FMU compile script that imports the Building library gives these errors:
Error at line 5, column 3, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find class declaration for BaseClasses
Error at line 5, column 41, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find component declaration for bandwidth
Error at line 71, column 32, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find class or component declaration for reference
Error at line 73, column 31, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find class or component declaration for u
Error at line 75, column 26, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find class or component declaration for u
Error at line 77, column 26, in file '../OnOffController.mo':

Error at line 84, column 18, in file '../OnOffController.mo':

Error at line 96, column 18, in file '../OnOffController.mo':

Error at line 98, column 18, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find class or component declaration for _zc_z2
Error at line 100, column 18, in file '../OnOffController.mo':
  Cannot find class or component declaration for _zc_der_z1

So the JModelica FMU was not yet run.
