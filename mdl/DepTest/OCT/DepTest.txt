DepTest Model OCT Notes

The OCT-r23206_JM-r14295 revision FMU dependencies have these issues
for QSS:
- Both event indicators show a reverse dependency on the output
variable o but o only appears in the second event indicator.
- The local variable l needs to be treated like an output variable
for QSS to get the necessary dependencies, including appearing as
a reverse dependency of the first event indicator and as a forward
dependency of the first event indicator.
- The output variable o should appear as a forward dependency of
the second event indicator.
- The variables modified in the event indicator handler block, l
and o, should not have forward dependencies on variables appearing
in the event indicator expressions since they should appear as
reverse dependencies of the event indicators.
