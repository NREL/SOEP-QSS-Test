Achilles2 Model Notes

This is the x2 half a simple 2-variable model of the decaying, oscillatory
"Achilles and the Tortoise" equations:
 x1' = 1.5 * x2 - 0.5 * x1
 x2' = -x1

The Achilles model is split into two parts, Achilles1 and Achilles2, to
demonstrate the use of input/output connections across FMUs.
