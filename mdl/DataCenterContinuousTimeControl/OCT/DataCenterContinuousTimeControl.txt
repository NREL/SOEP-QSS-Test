DataCenterContinuousTimeControl.txt Model OCT Notes

OCT gives a number of warnings when generating the FMU.

The OCT PyFMI simulation generates a number of warnings including
Singular Jacobian and Poor scaling so the solution accuracy is not
known.

The time range starts at a large value which causes some small steps to
be non-advancing in PyFMI simulations ("t + h = t on the next step").

As of the OCT-r23206_JM-r14295 OCT update an FMU built with 
generate_ode_jacobian still aborts under PyFMI and QSS with no error 
message (typically this indicates an abort during FMU initialization)
so we build without that option, which limits QSS zero-crossing protocol 
accuracy and robustness.
