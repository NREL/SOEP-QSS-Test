Scalable Model OCT Notes

1-Day Runs
1-day simulations of the 1x1 Scalable model were run with all the PyFMI solvers.
Both ncp=0 and maxh=0 (where relevant) were used to minimize simulation time.
The solutions (assessed from fan[1]].vol.dynBal.U) were generally close except
Dopri5 & RungeKutta34 go off track shortly after an apparent event at ~64,800 s.
Elapsed simulation times (s):
 CVode (stiff):                1.042315
 LSODAR (stiff):               3.21532
 Radau5ODE (stiff):           16.0078245
 RodasODE (stiff):             4.0068418
 RungeKutta34 (non-stiff):   514.9223673
 Dopri5 (non-stiff):         448.3619505
 ExplicitEuler (non-stiff): 1112.4118753999999
The stiff solvers are much faster: Scalable like most Buildings Library models,
is a stiff system.

OCT needs a significant amount of FMU build time and memory for the
larger 6x6 and 8x8 versions of this model. JVM was increased in the
bld_fmu.py file with:
  pymodelica.environ[ 'JVM_ARGS' ] = '-Xmx32768m'

The 12x12 model build with the default MinGW GCC compiler bundled with OCT
fails due to the size of the generated C files. Switching to the local MSVS
2022 compiler allowed the 12x12 model build to succeed.
