Scalable Model OCT Notes

OCT needs a significant amount of FMU build time and memory for the
larger 6x6 and 8x8 versions of this model. JVM was increased in the
bld_fmu.py file with:
  pymodelica.environ[ 'JVM_ARGS' ] = '-Xmx32768m'

The 12x12 model build with the default MinGW GCC compiler bundled with OCT
fails due to the size of the generated C files. Switching to the local MSVS
2022 compiler allowed the 12x12 model build to succeed.
