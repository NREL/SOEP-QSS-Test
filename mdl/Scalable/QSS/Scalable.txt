Scalable Model QSS Notes

Standard QSS demonstrates derivative sensitivities for self-dependent
continuous state variables. The experimental relaxed QSS2 solver has
significantly better performance but currently still makes smaller steps
than desired due to the derivative magnitudes even near the precise
trajectory.
