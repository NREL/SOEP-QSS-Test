SimpleHouse Model QSS Notes

As of the 2020/11 OCT update an FMU built with the generate_ode_jacobian option
aborts under PyFMI and QSS with no error message so we build without that option.

The QSS simulations run very slowly due to excessive requantizations
caused by numerical differentiation noise.

Using --dtND=5e-4 with QSS2 runs reduces but does not eliminate the issue.
Using --dtND=2e-4 with QSS3 runs gives similar results to QSS2 but cycle
timing is a little different. Neither tracks the reference PyFMI solution
tightly. QSS3 has excessive requantizations of event indicators 5 and 6 due
to ND noise causing it to run slower than QSS2.

QSS will not be efficient for this model until at least first derivatives
of event indicators are provided efficiently by the FMU.

Binned QSS runs are significantly faster for this model.
