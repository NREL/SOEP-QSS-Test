SimpleHouse Model QSS Notes

The QSS simulations run slowly due to the large number of requantizations
caused by numerical differentiation noise.

The zone.T variable is convenient as a basis for comparison but note that
if it is treated by QSS as a passive variable it will only have outputs
at sample times so it won't show accurate (event-driven) peaks unless a
small sampling time step is used.

Using --dtND=5e-4 with QSS2 runs reduces but does not eliminate the issue.

Using --dtND=2e-4 with QSS3 runs gives similar results to QSS2 but cycle
timing is a little different.

QSS3 has excessive requantizations of event indicators 5 and 6 due to ND
noise causing it to run slower than QSS2.

Binned QSS runs are significantly faster for this model.
