ZCBoolean2 Model QSS Notes

The OCT FMU's event indicators short-circuit local variables out of the dependencies.
For this model that means that yBoo and yBooPre do not appear in the dependencies.
QSS generates outputs for (non-state) local variables by treating them as if they
depend on all QSS variables and setting the FMU state before getting the local
variable values from the FMU: this works but is inefficient.

The event indicator dependency on u is "short-circuited" to a dependency on time,
which never requantizes, but the event indicators requantize as needed based on
the values and derivatives of u rather than getting observer updates from the
requantization of u.

The QSS2 runs need the --dtInf option to address deactivation of u=sin(t) at t=0
(its second derivative is zero so the next requantization time is t=infinity).
The event indicator derivatives are computed with ND so they generally won't
have exactly zero second derivatives at t=0 so we need --dtMax instead of --dtInf.

Notes
 x is linear between zero-crossing events so it's deactivated and exact in QSS2+.
 u is a local variable so QSS needs the local variable output option to see it.
