ZCBoolean2 Model Notes

This model includes zero-crossing functions and a conditional when block with boolean expressions.

Variables:
x        State    Real      der(x)=y
u        Real     Internal  sin(t)  (marked as an input but given an equation so causality is local)
y        Discrete Real
yBoo     Discrete Boolean
yBooPre  Discrete Boolean

Notes:
 Zero crossing at 0.5235 has no effect on y because it is already 1 (but it toggles yBoo causing the zero crossing functions to change trajectories)
 The 3 zero crossings that are not FMU events (due to yBoo in conditionals) are correctly ignored by the FMU
