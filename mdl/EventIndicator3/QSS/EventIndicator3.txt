EventIndicator3 Model QSS Notes

QSS zero crossing success for this model is sensitive to the dtND numerical
differentiation time step.

When the numeric differentiation causes the first zero crossing event
to occur slightly before the exact t=1 time the FMU calls appear to
show that the FMU detected the zero crossing but the discrete variable
(and thus the derivative) are not flipped to -1. The QSS-FMU zero
crossing coordination needs to be investigated/improved.

With exact math QSS2 and QSS3 don't do any requantizations since the state
trajectory is linear between zero-crossing events. In these runs the
numerical derivatives are accurate enough for no requantizations to occur.
