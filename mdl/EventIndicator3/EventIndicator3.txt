EventIndicator3 Model Notes

This is a simple event indicator test model with
a zero-crossing function that modifies a state
variable derivative via a discrete variable using
the pre() operator.

Notes:

OCT event indicators and their dependencies are
correct and short-circuit out the discrete variable
dependencies.

The OCT event indicators and PyFMI results match
the EventIndicator1 model as expected.

QSS should not track discrete variables that are
short-circuited since without dependencies they
are not updated by QSS.

Other than the discrete variable tracking, the QSS
results are good and do no requantizations as
expected in the ideal (infinite precision) case.

The QSS-FMU zero crossing coordination is not
working in some cases: this needs to be resolved.
