TimeTest Model QSS Notes

The QSS runs show two behaviors of interest:
* The discrete nextSample variable is short-circuited out
  of the dependencies as usual but then the event indicator
  (time - nextSample) variable is not updated when nextSample
  changes. This seems like a good example of how the short-
  circuiting can fail.
* The event indicator (time - nextSample) is getting the
  correct directional derivative of time, unlike the
  ACControl10 model with the analogous event indicator.
  This can be seen by requesting the diagnositic d output
  from QSS and looking at this initialization info:
  TimeTest Initialization: Stage XB =====
  ...
  !  _eventIndicator_1(0) = -1+1*Δ+0*Δ²
  This line in the ACControl10 model shows:
  !  _eventIndicator_1(0) = -1+0*Δ+0*Δ²
  and no reason for this discrepancy has been found yet.
