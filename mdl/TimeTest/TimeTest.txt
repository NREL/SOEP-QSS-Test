TimeTest Model Notes

Simple model with time variable to verify FMU time behavior.

The QSS runs reveal an issue with discrete variable dependency
elision. They also show the correct behavior for directional 
derivative of an event indicator based on time that is not
correct for the ACControl10 model.
