EventIndicator4 Model QSS Notes

QSS is not sensitive to the numerical differentiation time step but QSS2
needed zero-crossing control adjustments to capture all the crossings
(using --zMul=100 or --dtZMax=0.001 worked).

The sinusoids cause deactivation issues so --dtInf was used.

QSS3 takes so few steps that --dtMax=0.1 was used just to get better
plots (sampled output could also have been used).
