EventIndicator4 Model Notes

This is a simple event indicator test model with a
zero-crossing function that modifies a state variable
derivative via a discrete variable.

The zero-crossing functions are sinusoid that cross zero
(rather than functions that "bounce" off zero) to
demonstrate that the QSS-FMU zero-crossing approach works
well in this case and that the "bounce" crossings in other
models are more challenging.

Notes:

OCT event indicators and their dependencies are correct and
short-circuit out the local discrete variable dependencies.

The QSS results are good and do almost no requantizations
for the linear x and time variables as expected in the ideal
(infinite precision) case.  The sinusoidal event indicator
functions require requantizations and cause deactivation at
the start time with QSS2 (a zero highest derivative) and
near-deactivation with QSS3 (near-zero highest derivative)
so the --dtInf and --dtMax options are used.
