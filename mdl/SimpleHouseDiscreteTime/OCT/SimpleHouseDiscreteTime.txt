SimpleHouseDiscreteTime Model OCT Notes

After updating to this model to correspond to SimpleHouse it builds against
the Buildings Library master branch.

The normal and "reference" PyFMI (CVode) runs do not have the same zero
crossing behavior (e.g., compare _eventIndicator_32) so the model is
probably not numerically stable.

As of the 2020/11 OCT update an FMU built with the generate_ode_jacobian option
aborts under PyFMI with no error message so we build without that option.
