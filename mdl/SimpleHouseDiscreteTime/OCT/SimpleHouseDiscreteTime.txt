SimpleHouseDiscreteTime Model OCT Notes

The standard and "reference" PyFMI (CVode) runs show slight lagging
in some of event indicator curves from the standard tolerance run.

The event indicator switching is too fast for sampled output to pick up.
Run PyFMI with ncp=0 to get visualization of the event indicators

The time variable has strange InitialUnknowns dependencies:
<Unknown index="2066" dependencies="9 98 1048 1049 2508" />
