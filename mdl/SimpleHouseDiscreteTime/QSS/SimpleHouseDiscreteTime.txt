SimpleHouseDiscreteTime Model QSS Notes

The QSS simulation accuracy is hurt by numeric differentiation
such that zero-crossing events can be missed. Careful selection
of the dtND allows the QSS2 and QSS3 simulations to give correct
results but since the zero crossings in PyFMI simulations are also
not stable this model is not yet a good choice for QSS evaluation.
