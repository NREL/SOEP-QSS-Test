BIDR Model Notes

This is a small demo model for boolean, integer, discrete real, and non-discrete real
non-state (BIDR) variables showing the variations in how they can change to help in
understanding the range of behaviors QSS must support and in designing FMU annotations
to enable more efficient QSS simulation.

- BIDR variables can change outside of event indicator "handlers" so BIDR variables 
  can have observees and need to support QSS updates via observee changes.

- R variables dependent on (non-event-indicator) variables or on any if-clause based 
  event indicators (R-trajectory variables) need trajectories (and requantization)

- R variables only depending on when-clause event indicators (R-when variables) only
  change discretely so are effectively discrete and don't need trajectories.
  Event indicator annotations to identify whether they originate from an "if" or "when"
  block would allow these R variables to be treated more efficiently.
