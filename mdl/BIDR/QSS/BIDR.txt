BIDR Model QSS Notes

QSS is being revised to exploit the new Dependencies XML section to
correctly simulate this model.

OCT addition of event indicator annotations to distinguish "if" from "when" blocks
has been suggested to allow some real non-state variables that only change discretely 
to be handled more efficiently in QSS.
