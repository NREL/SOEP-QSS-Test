Guideline36Spring Model OCT Notes

With OCT-stable-r19089_JM-r14295 this model built with generate_ode_jacobian
progresses very slowly in PyFMI runs and generates a large number of
event indicators when QSS options are used.

With OCT-r23206_JM-r14295 the FMU builds of this model fail during the C
compilation (with or without QSS options enabled).
