Guideline36Spring Model QSS Notes

This model has a large number of event indicators:
  84 state variables
 900 event indicators
 Almost all EIs have many (50+) forward and reverse dependencies and most are the same
 Most of these EIs have observer updates after every state requantization so QSS will run slowly

QSS runs progress very slowly due to the event indicators.
